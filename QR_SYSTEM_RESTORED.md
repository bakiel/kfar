  data={{
    // Type-specific data
    id: string,
    name: string,

## Verification

To verify the QR system is working:
1. Visit any product page - check the QR in the sidebar
2. Add items to cart - check the "Save Cart for Later" QR
3. Go through checkout - check the order confirmation QR
4. Visit a vendor store - check the store access QR
5. Test the QR test page at `/test-qr-safe`

## Notes

- The SafeQR component is still available as a fallback if needed
- All QR codes now have full AI enhancement and interactive features
- The system gracefully falls back to MockAIService if the main AI service fails
- Mobile users get an optimized compact view by default
- Desktop users can toggle between compact and expanded views
