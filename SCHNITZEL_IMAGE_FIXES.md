# üçû Schnitzel Image Fixes Complete

## Issue Identified
Two products were using the same image (image 25), causing them to appear identical in the marketplace:
- **Schnitzel Strips Pack (td-009)** - was using image 25
- **Spinach & Herb Schnitzel (td-025)** - was using image 25

## Fix Applied
Changed **Schnitzel Strips Pack (td-009)** to use image 09 instead, eliminating the duplication.

## Current Schnitzel Products

### All 5 Schnitzel Products:
1. **Seitan Amerant Schnitzeloni (td-001)** - Image: breaded schnitzel cutlet
2. **Za'atar Schnitzel (td-028)** - Image 28: Middle Eastern herb-crusted  
3. **Spinach & Herb Schnitzel (td-025)** - Image 25: Green schnitzel with spinach
4. **Sesame-Crusted Schnitzel (td-030)** - Image 30: Extra crispy with sesame coating
5. **Schnitzel Strips Pack (td-009)** - Image 09: Pre-cut strips

## Verification
Each schnitzel product now has a unique image:
- ‚úÖ No duplicate images
- ‚úÖ Product descriptions match image content
- ‚úÖ All images are from Teva Deli collection

## Status
The duplicate image issue has been resolved. All schnitzel products should now display unique, appropriate images in the marketplace.
