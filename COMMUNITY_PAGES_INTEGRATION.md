# Community Pages Integration Guide

## Overview
The community pages are fully integrated into the KFAR Marketplace Next.js app system, supporting the Village of Peace's economic development goals by appealing to three key audiences:

1. **Community Members** - Internal resources and services
2. **Israeli Public** - Local tourism and vegan products (with Hebrew support)
3. **International Visitors** - Cultural experiences and diaspora connections
