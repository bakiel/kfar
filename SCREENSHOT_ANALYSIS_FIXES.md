# üì∏ Screenshot Analysis & Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified from Screenshots

### Screenshot 1 (Products showing wrong images):
1. **Seitan Amerant Schnitzeloni** - Was showing OKARA green box
2. **Kubeh Burger with Bulgur** - Was showing brown/chocolate product  
3. **Spinach & Herb Schnitzel** - Showing grid of products (might be correct)
4. **Sesame-Crusted Schnitzel** - Was showing sausage/salami product

### Screenshot 2 (More wrong images):
1. **Mediterranean Seitan Skewers** - Was showing OKARA green box
2. **Jerusalem Mixed Grill** - Was showing yellow OKARA box
3. **Plant-Based Shawarma** - Showing packaged product (needs verification)
4. **BBQ Pulled Seitan** - Showing BBQ product (appears correct)

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Image Reassignments:
1. **td-001** (Seitan Amerant Schnitzeloni): Changed to use image 01 instead of incorrect schnitzel image
2. **td-028** (Kubeh Burger): Changed to use proper kubeh image file
3. **td-030** (Sesame-Crusted Schnitzel): Changed to use image 02 instead of sausage image
4. **td-004** (Mediterranean Skewers): Changed from image 04 to image 10 (avoiding OKARA)
5. **td-008** (Jerusalem Mixed Grill): Changed from image 08 to image 12 (avoiding OKARA)

### üìù Key Insights:
- Images 01-10 appear to contain some OKARA products that weren't properly identified
- Image numbering doesn't always follow a clear pattern
- Some "specialty_product" images are actually OKARA or other categories

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Image 25** (Spinach Schnitzel) - The grid appearance might be correct if it's showing the product texture
2. **Early numbered images (01-10)** - May contain unidentified OKARA products
3. **Product naming** - Some products might need renaming to match their actual images

## Verification Steps

To verify these fixes:
1. Refresh the marketplace
2. Check Teva Deli products
3. Confirm that:
   - No schnitzels show OKARA boxes
   - Kubeh shows actual kubeh product
   - Mixed grill and skewers show appropriate products
   - All products match their descriptions
