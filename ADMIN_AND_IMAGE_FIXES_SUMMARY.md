## 4. Data Management Approach

### Philosophy: "Use what we have, refine don't recreate"

1. **Existing Data Structure Preserved**:
   - WordPress-style data layer maintained
   - Complete catalog system unchanged
   - Vendor store structure intact

2. **Enhancements Only**:
   - Added QR tracking layer
   - Fixed image mappings
   - Enhanced admin UI

3. **No Breaking Changes**:
   - All existing APIs work
   - Database structure unchanged
   - Frontend components compatible

## 5. QR Code Management for Store Owners

### How QR Tracking Works:

1. **Generation Phase**:
   - Each QR code gets unique signature
   - Metadata embedded (product, vendor, timestamp)
   - Tracked automatically on creation

2. **Scan Phase**:
   - User scans QR code
   - System logs: time, location, device
   - Analytics updated in real-time

3. **Admin Access**:
   - View all scans in dashboard
   - Filter by vendor/product/date
   - Export reports for analysis

### Benefits for Store Owners:
- See which products get most attention
- Track customer engagement
- Identify popular items
- Optimize inventory based on scans
