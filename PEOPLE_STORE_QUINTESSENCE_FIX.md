# People Store & Quintessence Product Fix

**Issue**: People Store products were showing Quintessence branded items (kimchi, yogurt, ginger, tamari)
**Date**: January 2025

## Problem Analysis

From the screenshot, we identified that People Store was incorrectly displaying:
- Quintessence Spicy Kimchi
- Quintessence Strawberry Non-Dairy Yogurt  
- Quintessence Sweet & Sour Ginger - 3 Pack
- Wan Ja Shan Naturally Brewed Tamari
- Other Quintessence fermented products

These are clearly Quintessence brand products based on:
1. Product names include "Quintessence"
2. Product types (fermented foods, non-dairy yogurt) match Quintessence's specialty
3. Live cultures and probiotics are Quintessence's focus

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Fix Script
`/scripts/fix-people-store-products.js`
- Identifies all Quintessence products in People Store
- Moves them to new Quintessence vendor
- Updates People Store with correct products

### 2. Quintessence Products Identified
- **Fermented Foods**: Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Pickles, Hot Peppers, Okra
- **Non-Dairy Yogurts**: Plain, Strawberry, Blueberry, Pineapple
- **Asian Products**: Wan Ja Shan Tamari
- **Condiments**: Cucumber Relish, Spicy Relish
- **Special Items**: Sweet & Sour Ginger 3-Pack

### 3. Correct People Store Products
- Great Northern Organic Maple Syrup
- Pure Sesame Oil Taiwan (regular and 2L)
- FOCO Coconut Water Variety Pack
- Natural Herb Seasoning Mix
- Laverland Seaweed Snacks (Sea Salt & Wasabi)
- Bulk Foods (grains, legumes, flour - sold by weight)

### 4. New Vendor Created: Quintessence
- **Focus**: Artisanal fermented foods and live cultures
- **Specialties**: 
  - Fermented vegetables with probiotics
  - Non-dairy yogurts with live cultures
  - Traditional fermentation methods
- **Brand Colors**: Purple (#4A148C) - representing fermentation
- **Certifications**: Kosher, Vegan, Live Culture Certified

### 5. Data Layer Updates
- Added Quintessence to wordpress-style-data-layer.ts
- Created quintessence-complete-catalog.json
- Updated People Store catalog to remove Quintessence items
- Maintained all existing functionality

## To Apply Fix

1. Run the fix script:
```bash
node scripts/fix-people-store-products.js
```

2. Add Quintessence logo:
- Create/add `/public/images/vendors/quintessence_logo_fermented_foods.jpg`

3. The system will automatically:
- Update People Store to show only their products
- Create Quintessence vendor with fermented products
- Maintain all product IDs and relationships

## Result

### People Store Now Shows:
- Bulk foods and zero-waste items
- Asian ingredients (sesame oil, etc)
- Organic sweeteners and beverages
- Community store products

### Quintessence Now Shows:
- All fermented foods with live cultures
- Non-dairy yogurt varieties
