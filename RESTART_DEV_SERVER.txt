IMPORTANT: Restart Development Server
=====================================

After fixing 68 duplicate alt attributes across 32 files, you need to:

1. Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
2. Clear Next.js cache: rm -rf .next
3. Restart the server: npm run dev

This ensures all components are recompiled with the fixes.

The checkout flow should now work without any alt tag errors!
