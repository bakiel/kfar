# Image Alt Attribute Audit Report

## Summary
This report identifies all Image components in the home page (app/page.tsx) and its imported components, checking for missing or potentially problematic alt attributes.

## Findings

### 1. HeroSection.tsx
All Image components have proper alt attributes:
- Line 141: `alt={`Happy KFAR customer ${i}`}` - ✅ Good
- Line 181: `alt={slide.title}` - ✅ Good

### 2. VillageEnterprises.tsx
All Image components have proper alt attributes:
- Line 251: `alt={currentEnterprise.name}` - ✅ Good
- Line 353: `alt={feature.caption}` - ✅ Good

### 3. FeaturedProducts.tsx
All Image components have proper alt attributes:
- Line 224: `alt={product.name}` - ✅ Good
- Line 277: `alt={product.vendor}` - ✅ Good

### 4. ReviewsSection.tsx
All Image components have proper alt attributes:
- Line 224: `alt={review.name}` - ✅ Good
- Line 257: `alt={review.vendor}` - ✅ Good
- Line 299: `alt={review.product}` - ✅ Good
- Line 347: `alt={review.name}` - ✅ Good

### 5. CommunityServices.tsx
No Image components found - uses background images and icons only.

### 6. StatsSection.tsx
No Image components found - uses background images and icons only.

### 7. TechFeatures.tsx
No Image components found - uses icons only.

### 8. TechDemoSection.tsx
No Image components found - imports QRNFCAnimation which also doesn't use Image components.

### 9. ProductImage.tsx (Utility Component)
Has proper alt attribute handling:
- Lines 61 & 77: `alt={alt}` - ✅ Good (receives alt as prop)

## Potential Issues for Flickering

### 1. Missing Priority Attribute
Some images that appear above the fold might benefit from the `priority` attribute:
- **HeroSection.tsx**: The hero slide images should have `priority={true}` for the first slide
- **VillageEnterprises.tsx**: The initial enterprise logo and featured images could benefit from priority loading

### 2. Missing Sizes Attribute
For responsive images using `fill`, the `sizes` attribute helps optimize loading:
- Multiple components use `fill` without specifying `sizes`

### 3. Placeholder/BlurDataURL
Only **ProductImage.tsx** implements blur placeholders. Other components could benefit from this to reduce layout shift.

## Recommendations

1. **Add priority to above-the-fold images**:
   - HeroSection: Add `priority={index === 0}` is already implemented ✅
   - VillageEnterprises: Consider adding priority for the initial active enterprise

2. **Add sizes attribute** for responsive images to optimize loading

3. **Implement blur placeholders** for all Image components to reduce flickering

4. **Consider lazy loading** for below-the-fold images (Next.js Image does this by default, but ensure it's not disabled)

## Conclusion

All Image components in the home page and its imported components have proper alt attributes. The main concern for flickering would be:
1. Missing blur placeholders in most components
2. Potential missing priority attributes for critical images
3. Missing sizes attributes for responsive images

No missing alt attributes were found that would cause accessibility issues.
