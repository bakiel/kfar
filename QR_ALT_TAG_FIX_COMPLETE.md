# QR Code Alt Tag Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issue Description
When navigating to the checkout page, Next.js was throwing an error:
```
Image is missing required alt property. Please add Alternative Text to describe the image for screen-reader users.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Dynamic Image Creation in QR Components**
The QR code components (`SmartQRGenerator` and `SmartQRGeneratorCompact`) were creating HTMLImageElement objects using `new Image()` for canvas operations:

```javascript
const qrImg = new Image();
const logoImg = new Image();
```

These Image objects, while never rendered to the DOM, were being detected by Next.js's strict accessibility checks as missing alt attributes.

### 2. **Unused Import**
The `QRCodePayment` component had an unused import:
```javascript
import Image from 'next/image';
```
This import was not being used anywhere in the component but might have triggered additional checks.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. **Added Alt Attributes to Dynamic Images**

In both `SmartQRGenerator.tsx` and `SmartQRGeneratorCompact.tsx`:

```javascript
// Before
const qrImg = new Image();
const logoImg = new Image();

// After
const qrImg = new Image();
qrImg.alt = 'QR Code';
const logoImg = new Image();
logoImg.alt = 'Logo';
```

### 2. **Removed Unused Import**

In `QRCodePayment.tsx`:
```javascript
// Removed: import Image from 'next/image';
```

### 3. **Verified All Rendered Images Have Alt Tags**

All `<img>` elements in the QR components already had proper alt attributes:
- SmartQRGeneratorCompact.tsx (lines 231-239, 427-432)
- All use descriptive alt text based on the QR type

## Files Modified

1. `/components/qr/SmartQRGeneratorCompact.tsx`
   - Added alt attributes to dynamically created Image objects (lines 140, 142)

2. `/components/qr/SmartQRGenerator.tsx`
   - Added alt attributes to dynamically created Image objects (lines 111, 113)

3. `/components/checkout/QRCodePayment.tsx`
   - Removed unused Image import from next/image (line 4)

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the development server
2. Add items to cart
3. Navigate to checkout (`/checkout`)
4. Select QR Code Payment method
5. Verify no alt tag errors appear in console
6. Complete a test checkout to ensure QR code generation works properly

## Why This Works

The `new Image()` constructor creates HTMLImageElement objects that are used internally by the canvas API to draw the QR code. While these images are never added to the DOM and thus don't need alt attributes for accessibility, Next.js's strict mode was detecting them during its build-time checks.

By adding alt attributes to these Image objects, we satisfy Next.js's requirements while maintaining the functionality of the QR code generation.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always add alt attributes to any Image elements, even if they're only used programmatically
2. Remove unused imports, especially for components like Next.js Image that have strict requirements
3. Use ESLint rules to catch missing alt attributes during development
