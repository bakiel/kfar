4. **Code Updates**:

   - `lib/config/storage.ts` - Now serves local images only

### Current State:
- ✅ No Supabase imports in code

- ✅ No Supabase environment variables
- ✅ All images served locally from `/public/images/`
- ✅ Product data loaded from `lib/data/products.ts`

### Next Steps:

2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. For new local-first development, see `/kfar-marketplace/` directory
4. Follow `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for the new architecture

### Important Notes:
- This Next.js app is now in legacy/reference mode
- New development should use the local-first Node.js + Express stack
- All UI components and assets can be reused in the new architecture
- No external database connections are required to run this app
