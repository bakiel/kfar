# Teva Deli Image Fixes Applied

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### Image Swaps to Fix Mismatches:

1. **Hot Dogs (td-013)** â†’ Now uses image 11 (which actually shows hot dogs)
   - Was: `product_13` 
   - Now: `product_11`

2. **Marinated Tofu Steaks (td-011)** â†’ Now uses image 13
   - Was: `product_11` (showed hot dogs)
   - Now: `product_13`

3. **Seitan Bacon Strips (td-012)** â†’ Now uses image 14
   - Was: `product_12` (showed plain white tofu)
   - Now: `product_14`

## ðŸ“Š Summary

The issue was that the numbered image files didn't match their product assignments:
- Image 11 contains HOT DOGS but was assigned to Tofu Steaks
- Image 12 contains plain white tofu/seitan but was assigned to Bacon Strips

By reassigning the images to the correct products, the display should now match the product names.

## âœ… Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Refresh the store page: http://localhost:3000/store/teva-deli
3. Verify:
   - "Vegan Hot Dogs" now shows hot dog package
   - "Marinated Tofu Steaks" shows proper tofu steaks
   - "Seitan Bacon Strips" shows bacon-style strips
   - All other products display correctly

The catalog has been synchronized between:
- `teva-deli-complete-catalog.ts`
- `teva-deli-catalog.ts`

Both files now contain the corrected image mappings.
