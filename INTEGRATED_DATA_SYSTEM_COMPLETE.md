## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action → React Component → useIntegratedData Hook → API Endpoint
                                                              ↓
                                                     Data Integration Hub
                                                         ↙    ↓    ↘
                                            Tag Manager  QR Service  Analytics
                                                    ↘      ↓      ↙
                                                     Product Data
                                                          ↓
                                                   Enhanced Response
```

## Fixed Issues

1. **TypeScript Compliance**: All products now have required `tags` property
2. **Data Import**: People Store products properly integrated with tags
3. **Vendor Tags**: All vendors have appropriate tag categorization
4. **API Integration**: Complete data threading through all endpoints

## Usage Examples

### Track Product View
```typescript
const { trackView } = useIntegratedData({ customerId });
await trackView(productId, 'web');
```

### Get Tagged Products
```typescript
const { getProductsByTags } = useIntegratedData();
const veganProducts = await getProductsByTags(['vegan', 'organic']);
```

### Scan QR Code
```typescript
const { scanQR } = useIntegratedData();
const result = await scanQR(qrCode);
if (result.redirectUrl) {
  window.location.href = result.redirectUrl;
}
```

### Get Personalized Recommendations
```typescript
const { getRecommendations } = useIntegratedData({ customerId });
const recommendations = await getRecommendations({
  currentProduct: productId,
  category: 'desserts'
});
```
