# üö® Critical Image Issue Report

## Core Problem Identified

The fundamental issue is that **many Teva Deli image files contain different products than their filenames suggest**.

### Examples:
- `teva_deli_vegan_specialty_product_10_plant_based_meat_alternative_israeli_cuisine.jpg` ‚Üí Actually shows tofu package
- `teva_deli_vegan_specialty_product_12_seitan_tofu_based_protein_alternative.jpg` ‚Üí Actually shows tofu block
- Files named "meat_alternative" often contain tofu products
- Files named "burger_schnitzel" might contain OKARA products

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Temporary Fixes Applied:
1. **Mediterranean Seitan Skewers** ‚Üí Moved to image 32 (shawarma/kebab range)
2. **Jerusalem Mixed Grill** ‚Üí Moved to image 38 (shawarma/kebab range)
3. **Plant-Based Shawarma** ‚Üí Moved to image 35 (shawarma range)

### ‚ùå Still Problematic:
- Many products may still have mismatched images
- The image numbering system doesn't match product categories
- Some "specialty" products are using tofu images

## Root Cause

The image files were likely:
1. Batch uploaded with generic names
2. Not properly matched to their content
3. Named based on intended use rather than actual content

## Recommended Solution

### Short Term (Current):
- We've reassigned the most obviously wrong products to more appropriate images
- This is a band-aid solution

### Long Term (Proper Fix):
1. **Visual Audit**: Manually inspect all 43 Teva Deli images
2. **Create Mapping**: Document what each image ACTUALLY shows
3. **Rename Files**: Update filenames to match content (e.g., `teva_deli_tofu_package_01.jpg`)
4. **Reassign Products**: Match products to images based on actual content, not filename

## Impact

Without proper image mapping:
- Customers see wrong products
- Trust in the marketplace is reduced
- Products appear unprofessional

## Immediate Action Items

1. Test the current fixes to see if they improve the situation
2. Consider hiring someone to visually audit all images
3. Create a proper image catalog with descriptions
